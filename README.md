SoftUni Programing Fundamentals with JS - additional project

This is an additional - individual project from the SoftUni program for basic knowledge of programming with JavaScript. The idea is to create the "guess the number" game as a console application and store it in a new repository to practice the material learned in the past lectures.

The project eternals is a game development project that aims to create a fun and engaging experience for the player. The core mechanics involve the computer randomly selecting a number between 0 and 100, and providing feedback to the player's guesses to help them identify the number. As an additional feature, I have implemented a scoring system and multiple difficulty levels to make the game more challenging and exciting. Additionally, I have chosen to include a character named "Peter the Snake" as a playful way of representing the computer, who gives intuitive explanations during the game, to make the experience more enjoyable.
